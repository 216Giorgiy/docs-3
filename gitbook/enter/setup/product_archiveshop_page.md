# Product Archive/Shop Page

A Product Archive/Shop page is a **WooCommerce** page used to display the products added. It displays according to the settings given in **WooCommerce > Settings > Products**.

## Available Layouts

In **Enter** theme, the Shop Page can be displayed in 3 available layouts which are :
1. **Left Sidebar** - This is the default layout of Shop page in our theme. It has a content section occupying 75% of the screen and a widgetized sidebar section to its left occupying 25% of the screen.
2. **Right Sidebar** - This layout is same as the Left Sidebar layout except that the sidebar section is in the right side of the screen.
3. **Full-width** - This layout does not contain any sidebars. The entire screen has the content section.

You can select the layout of the shop from **Enter > Shop > Shop/Catalog Pages > Shop Page Layout**.

## Content Section

The Content Section of the Shop Page displays either Products or Categories or both depending on the choice given in **Shop Page Display** option under **WooCommerce > Settings > Products**.

### Displaying Product Categories

Product Categories/ Subcategories are displayed according to the layout in grids. It will display the **Product Category image** and **Product Category Title**. We recommend displaying only Products in Product Archive/Shop Pages.

### Displaying Product Items

In Product Archive/Shop Page, product items can be displayed by choosing number of columns for displaying products in shop and catalog pages.
