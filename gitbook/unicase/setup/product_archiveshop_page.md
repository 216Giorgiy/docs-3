2. **Right Sidebar** - This layout is same as the Left Sidebar layout except that the sidebar section is in the right side of the screen.
3. **Full-width** - This layout does not contain any sidebars. The entire screen has the content section.

You can select the layout of the shop from **Unicase > Shop Tab > Shop/Catalog Pages > Shop/Catalog Pages Layout**.

You can set the number of items displayed from **Unicase > Shop Tab > Shop/Catalog Pages > Number of Products Per Page**.
