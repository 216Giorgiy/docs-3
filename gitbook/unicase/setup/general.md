# General Setup

## Setting the Home Page

By default, Wordpress displays blog posts in the home page but we will display a static page as our homage page.
1. For that we'll have to create a page and call it home.
2. Create another Page from **Pages > Add New ** and name it **Blog**.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Reading ** and choose **A static page** radio button option for **Front page displays** settings.

We'll create the contents of the Blog and Home page later.

## Other General Setup

1. [**Logo and Favicon**](logo_and_favicon.md)
2. [**Header**](header.md)
3. [**Footer**](footer.md)


## Configuring Demo Pages

Unicase is bundled with two different demos which you can use to change and feel of your site with only a few clicks in the Styling Option Panel.

* Demo 1 -  Demo 1 is configured with **Style 2** option which has **Roboto** and **Fjalla Font** font.

* Demo 2 - Demo 2 is configured with **style 1** option which has  **Roboto** and **Roboto Black** font.

In default Unicase is in **Style 2** option, if you want to configure your theme into **Style 1** that is showing in **demo version 2**, please navigate to Unicase > Styling > Style in your wordpress dashboard and ensure that the option set like this

* Style: Style 1
