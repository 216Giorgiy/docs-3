# Product Attributes

Product Attributes are pieces of data that can add more technical information to your product and help you to refine your catalog while browsing/searching. It works in exactly the same way as product Categories. For example, you can add extra product data like '*Color*','*Size*' or '*Brand*' to your products.

## Adding New Attributes to your product

Setting up attributes themselves uses an interface you will be familiar with. Itâ€™s recommended that you set up any **Attribute** you will be using over and over in this way. Navigate to **Products > Attributes** and you will be presented with the following screen:
