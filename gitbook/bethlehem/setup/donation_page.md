### Choosing Layout for Donation Page

In **Bethlehem** theme, the donation page can be displayed in 2 available layouts which are :
1. **Left Sidebar** - This is the default layout of Donation page in our theme. It has a content section occupying 75% of the screen and a widgetized sidebar section to its left occupying 25% of the screen.
2. **Right Sidebar** - This layout is same as the Left Sidebar layout except that the sidebar section is in the right side of the screen.

You can select the layout of the donation from **Bethlehem > Donations Tab > Layout Settings > Donation Page Layout**.

### Choosing Header Background

If you want a particular background for your header on donation page,  then set **Header Background** option as **Default BG** or **Custom**. **Custom** means pick your own style with multiple options.

You can pick header background option from **Bethlehem > Donations Tab > General > Header Background**.

### Number of donations displayed per page

Once we have chosen the donation page layout, we'll have the number of donations displayed per page. The number of donations per page is recommended to be a multiple of the number of donations displayed per row.

You can set the number of items displayed from **Bethlehem > Donations Tab > General > Number of Donations Per Page**
