### Choosing Header Background

If you want a particular background for your header on stories page,  then set **Header Background** option as **Default BG** or **Custom**. **Custom** means pick your own style with multiple options.

You can pick header background option from **Bethlehem > Stories Tab > General > Header Background**.


#### Number of stories displayed per page

Once we have chosen the stories page layout, we'll have the number of stories displayed per page. The number of stories per page is recommended to be a multiple of the number of stories displayed per row.

You can set the number of items displayed from **Bethlehem > Stories Tab > General > Number of Stories Per Page**
