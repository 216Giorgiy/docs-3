If you want a particular background for your header on events page,  then set **Header Background** option as **Default BG** or **Custom**. **Custom** means pick your own style with multiple options.

You can pick header background option from **Bethlehem > Events Tab > General > Header Background**.

### Choosing Layout for Event Page

Bethlehem allows you to display your events page in 2 different layouts and in 2 different styles.

### Layouts

1. **Sidebar Right** - This is the default layout. The Events page will have 2 columns divided roughly into 75% and 25%. The 75% of the screen is the main content and it displays the events. The 25% screen of the screen is the sidebar and it displays widgets. As the name suggests, the sidebar will be to the right side of the screen.
2. **Sidebar Left** - Same as **Sidebar Right** except that the **Sidebar** appears to the left of the screen.

You can select the layout of the events from **Bethlehem > Events Tab > Layout Settings > Events Page Layout**.

## Sidebar Section

### Events Sidebar

This widgetized area contains widgets that generally go into event's sidebar. In the default preview we have used :

1. **Categories(Custom Post Type)** Widget : Display Events by Categories.
2. **Events Sort By Month** Widget : Display Events by Month.
3. **MailChimp Sign-Up Form** Widget : Display Newsletter Sign-up Form to know about new Events.
