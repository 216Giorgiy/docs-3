## Content Section

The Content Section of the Shop Page displays either Products or Categories or both depending on the choice given in **Shop Page Display** option under **WooCommerce > Settings > Products**.

### Displaying Product Categories

Product Categories/ Subcategories are displayed according to the layout in grids. It will display the **Product Category image** and **Product Category Title**. We recommend displaying only Products in Product Archive/Shop Pages.

### Displaying Product Items

#### Number of Product Columns

In Product Archive/Shop Page, product items can be displayed by choosing number of columns for displaying products in shop and catalog pages.

You can select the Product Columns under **MyBag > Shop Tab > Shop/Catalog Pages > No of Product Columns**.

#### Number of Product Items displayed per Page

Once we have chosen the shop layout, we'll have the number of product items displayed per row. The number of product items per page is recommended to be a multiple of the number of product items displayed per row.

You can set the number of items displayed from **MyBag > Shop Tab > Shop/Catalog Pages > Number of Products Per Page**.

#### Animating the Product Items

Product items can be animated when the appear on viewport. More than 25+ CSS3 animation effects are available which includes :

1. BounceIn

3. FlipIn
4. LightSpeedIn
5. RotateIn
6. RoleIn

You can set whether you want to animate the product item from **MyBag > Shop Tab > Product Item Settings > Product Item Animation **.

#### Animation Delay Option

Animation-delay property specifies when the animation should start. This lets the animation sequence begin some time after it's applied to an element.

You can enable/disable animation delay from **MyBag > Shop Tab > Product Item Settings > Should Delay Animation**.

#### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of an image until the point at which it is needed i.e. when the image appears in the viewport. This will contribute to faster page loading since the images are not loaded until required.

You can enable/disable Lazy loading of Thumbnail images from **MyBag > Shop Tab > Product Item Settings > Thumbnail Lazy loading**.
