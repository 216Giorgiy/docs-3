# Blog Page

Blog page displays according to the settings given in **Settings > Reading**.

## Blog Post

Pizzaro supports 'image', 'gallery', 'video', 'audio', 'quote' and 'link' posts formats. Video and audio post formats, if self hosted, will be displayed using **JPlayer**. Gallery images are displayed as a carousel using **Owl Carousel**.

### Choosing a Blog Page Layout

Pizzaro allows you to display your Blog posts in 3 different layouts.

1. **Sidebar Right** - This is the default layout. The Blog page will have 2 columns divided roughly into 75% and 25%. The 75% of the screen is the main content and it displays the blog posts. The 25% screen of the screen is the sidebar and it displays widgets. As the name suggests, the sidebar will be to the right side of the screen.
2. **Sidebar Left** - Same as **Sidebar Right** except that the **Sidebar** appears to the left of the screen.
3. **Full-width** - This layout does not display any sidebars.

You can select blog page layout form **Pizzaro > Blog > Blog Page Layout**.

## Sidebar

If a sidebar layout is chosen, then the sidebar is populated with widgets.
